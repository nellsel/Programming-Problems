A city is divided into N regions, labelled A - Z. All regions of the city are connected to 0 or more other regions via roads or railway. In this city there has been an outbreak of cliché and zombies are eating everyone. It takes 1 week for the zombies to spread from an infected region to a non-infected region and make it infected, but there are survivors in each region trying to stop the zombies from spreading. In order to infect a region, at least 3 neighbouring regions must be infected for at least a week. In this situation the zombies can overwhelm the survivors.

Your task is to determine the number of weeks it will take for the entire city to be infected, or if it is impossible for zombies to infect all regions.

Constraints:
3 <= N <= 26
0 <= K <= 100

Input format:
The first line is an integer N, the number of regions in the city.
The second line is an integer K, the number of connections that exist between regions of the city.
The third line contains a 3 letter string indicating the initial infected regions.
This is followed by K lines, each containing a 2 letter string XY indicating a connection between region X and region Y. Regions that are connected are connected both ways, so X is connected to Y and Y is connected to X.

Output format:
Output either the string:
“Full infection is not possible.”
Or:
“Full infection will happen in X weeks.”
Where X is the number of weeks it will take for all regions of the city to be infected.
