Right circular rotation is an array operation which shifts each element one position to the right, with a[n-1] taking the place of a[0].

e.g. [1, 2, 3, 4, 5] shifted right 2 times is [4, 5, 1, 2, 3]

An array A of N integers has been shifted right K times. You will be asked Q queries which consist of a single integer X. You must print the value A[X].

Constraints:
1 <= N <= 10^5
1 <= A[i] <= 10^5
1 <= K <= 10^5
1 <= Q <= 5000
0 <= X <= N-1

Input Format:
The first line contains 3 integers, N, K and Q, separated by spaces.
The second line is N integers separated by spaces, which are the elements of A.
These are followed by Q lines of a single integer, X.

Output Format:
For each query Q, print out the value of A[X] on a new line.
