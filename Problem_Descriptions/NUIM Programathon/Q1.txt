Given 2 strings A and B you need to determine the minimum total number of letters which need to be removed from both strings to transform them into anagrams of one another.

e.g.
A = “hello”
B = “lol”
The answer is 2 as deleting the “h” and “e” from “hello” will make it an anagram of “lol”.

Constraints:
A and B wil be composed of lowercase latin letters a-z
1 <= length of A & B <= 10^6

Input Format:
2 lines, each containing a single string.

Ouput Format:
A single integer which is the number of characters which should be deleted from A and B
